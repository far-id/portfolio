	summary: `
		A curious mind and full-stack developer who finds joy in turning ideas into functional web experiences.
		I’ve built with React, Next.js, Laravel, and PostgreSQL — and occasionally wrestle with cloud and AI tools
		like Google Cloud and Gemini AI. I believe good code tells a story: clean, reliable, and made with intent.

		Fueled by curiosity (and coffee), I’m eager to build things that people *actually* love to use —
		experiences that feel intuitive, reliable, and alive. Every project is an opportunity to learn,
		to refine, and to create something that genuinely matters.
